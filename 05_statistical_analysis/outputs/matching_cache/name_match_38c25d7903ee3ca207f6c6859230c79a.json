{"match": false, "confidence": 0.1, "reasoning": "The names 'Michael M. Tom' and 'Michael McNulty' do not share significant similarities in their structure or common variations. The middle initial 'M' in the first name does not correspond to 'Mc' in the second name, and there are no apparent cultural or hyphenated naming connections that would suggest they are the same person."}
