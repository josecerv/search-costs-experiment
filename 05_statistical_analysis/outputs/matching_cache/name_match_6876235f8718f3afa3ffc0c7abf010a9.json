{"match": true, "confidence": 0.85, "reasoning": "The names share a common structure and similar components, with 'Javier' being a common first name that could be omitted in some contexts. The last names are identical except for the character encoding issue in 'Ch\u00e1vez-Dom\u00ednguez', which suggests they are the same name represented differently. The presence of a middle name and hyphenation aligns with cultural naming conventions."}
