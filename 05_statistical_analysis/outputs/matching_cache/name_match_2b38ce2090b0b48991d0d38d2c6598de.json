{"match": true, "confidence": 0.85, "reasoning": "The names share the same first name 'Alejandro' and a similar last name structure with 'Chavez-Dominguez' and 'Ch\u00e1vez-Dom\u00ednguez', suggesting they are likely the same person. The variation in the first name 'Javier' could indicate a middle name or a cultural naming practice. The hyphenation and accents in the last names are consistent with Spanish naming conventions."}
