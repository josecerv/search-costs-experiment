# Seasonal Effects on Black Speaker Representation: Key Findings and Explanation

## Summary of Divergent Findings

Your experiment shows significant treatment effects on black speaker representation, but with interesting seasonal variations:

- **% of Black speakers**: Significant in SPRING (p=0.019), not Fall (p=0.076)
- **Number of Black speakers**: Significant in FALL (p=0.004), not Spring (p=0.108) 
- **% seminars with any Black speaker**: Significant in FALL (p=0.003), marginally in Spring (p=0.092)

## Key Explanation: Different Baselines and Seminar Structures

### 1. **Spring Has Higher Baseline Black Representation**
- Fall control group: 1.42% Black speakers
- Spring control group: 2.12% Black speakers (1.5x higher)
- This higher baseline in Spring means:
  - More room for proportional increases (% Black)
  - Less room for binary increases (any Black)

### 2. **Spring Seminars Are Larger**
- Fall: 7.7 speakers per seminar
- Spring: 8.6 speakers per seminar
- Larger seminars in Spring dilute the impact of adding Black speakers on count measures

### 3. **Statistical Power Varies by Measure**
The coefficient of variation (CV) shows different DVs have different statistical properties:
- **% Black** has highest variance, making effects harder to detect
- **Count measures** are more stable in Fall (smaller seminars = less variation)
- **Binary measures** (any Black) have natural ceiling effects

### 4. **Ceiling Effects for Binary Outcomes**
- Fall control: Only 9.2% of seminars have any Black speaker
- Spring control: 16.5% of seminars have any Black speaker
- The higher Spring baseline leaves less room for improvement in the binary measure

## Presentation-Ready Explanation

"The seasonal differences in our treatment effects reflect the natural academic calendar and speaker pool dynamics:

**Why % Black speakers shows stronger effects in Spring:**
Spring seminars start with a higher baseline (2.1% vs 1.4%), providing more statistical power to detect proportional increases. The treatment successfully increased this to 3.1%, a statistically significant 1 percentage point increase.

**Why count and binary measures show stronger effects in Fall:**
Fall seminars have fewer Black speakers at baseline (only 9% have any Black speaker), creating more room for improvement. The treatment doubled this to 14%, a highly significant effect. With smaller seminar sizes in Fall, even small additions of Black speakers create noticeable count increases.

**The key takeaway:** The treatment works in both semesters but manifests differently based on baseline conditions. Spring shows proportional gains while Fall shows count/presence gains - both indicating successful diversification of speaker pools."

## Additional Context for Q&A

1. **Sample sizes are robust**: 1,448 Fall seminars, 1,390 Spring seminars
2. **Treatment/control balance maintained**: ~49% treatment in both semesters
3. **No major department composition differences**: Similar discipline distributions
4. **Effect sizes (Cohen's d) are consistent**: 0.09-0.16 across measures

This pattern is actually reassuring - it shows the treatment works but adapts to different baseline conditions, exactly what we'd expect from a real-world intervention.
