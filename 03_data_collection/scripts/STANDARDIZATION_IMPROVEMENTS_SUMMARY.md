# University Standardization Improvements Summary

## Date: June 3, 2025

### Overview
Successfully improved the university standardization process to better group related affiliations together, focusing on superordinate universities rather than departments or campus variations.

### Key Improvements Made

#### 1. Enhanced Known Mappings (lines 148-260 in `standardize_universities.py`)
Added explicit mappings for problematic universities:
- **Arizona State University** variants (ASU, ASU Polytechnic, School of Life Sciences)
- **Georgia Institute of Technology** variants (Georgia Tech, GT, GaTech)
- **Case Western Reserve University** variants (Case Western, CWRU)
- **Academia Sinica** variants (with Taiwan, multiple spaces)
- **Santa Fe Institute** (fixed typo: "Sante Fe Institute")
- **Aix-Marseille University** (fixed encoding issues)

#### 2. Improved Extraction Patterns (lines 257-288)
Added new patterns to handle:
- `University - School of X` → Extract university
- `University, Polytechnic/Campus` → Extract university  
- Multiple universities listed → Take first one
- Better handling of lab groups and departments

#### 3. Updated LLM Instructions (lines 446-514)
- Clarified that campus variations within same city should be grouped
- Only preserve satellite campuses in different cities (e.g., NYU Shanghai)
- Added instruction to fix encoding issues
- Added instruction to take first university when multiple listed

#### 4. Fixed Character Encoding (lines 227-251)
Added encoding fixes for common issues:
- `Ã©` → `é`
- `Ã¨` → `è`
- And other accented characters

### Results

#### Successfully Standardized ✅
- **Arizona State University**: All variants now correctly map to main university
  - "Arizona State University - School of Life Sciences" → "Arizona State University"
  - "Arizona State University, Polytechnic" → "Arizona State University"
  - Count: 106 occurrences

- **Case Western Reserve University**: All variants merged
  - "Case Western Reserve University, Department of Biology" → "Case Western Reserve University"
  - Count: 66 occurrences

- **Academia Sinica**: All variants merged
  - "Academia Sinica, Taiwan" → "Academia Sinica"
  - "Academia Sinica  University of Utah" → "Academia Sinica"
  - Count: 11 occurrences

- **Santa Fe Institute**: Typo fixed
  - "Sante Fe Institute" → "Santa Fe Institute"
  - Count: 7 occurrences

- **Aix-Marseille University**: Encoding fixed
  - "Aix-Marseille UniversitÃ©" → "Aix-Marseille University"
  - Count: 5 occurrences

#### Remaining Issue
- One instance of "Georgia Institute of Technology  SLMath" still exists
- Fix has been added to cache, requires pipeline re-run

### Statistics
- **Total university mentions**: 24,041
- **Unique standardized universities**: 2,961 (down from ~4,000+ before improvements)
- **"INVALID" entries**: 393 (legitimate non-university affiliations)

### Recommendations

1. **Run the pipeline again** to apply the Georgia Tech SLMath fix:
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/c/Users/jcerv/Jose/search-costs/03_data_collection/scripts
   ./run_final_pipeline.sh
   ```

2. **Consider handling "INVALID" entries** by creating a separate category for:
   - Companies/Industry (e.g., "GlareDB", "Creating Value LLC")
   - Research organizations (e.g., "Lowell Observatory")
   - Ambiguous locations (e.g., "Durham", "BC")

3. **National Laboratories** could be more consistently handled:
   - Some have "ORG:" prefix, others don't
   - Consider standardizing all to either have or not have the prefix

### Files Modified
1. `/03_data_collection/scripts/standardize_universities.py` - Main standardization logic
2. Created test scripts:
   - `test_standardization_fixes.py` - Unit tests for standardization
   - `verify_standardization_results.py` - Verification of final dataset
   - `clear_problematic_cache_entries.py` - Cache cleaning utility
   - `check_specific_issues.py` - Diagnostic tool
   - `fix_remaining_issues.py` - Manual cache fixes

### How to Maintain
1. When new problematic patterns emerge, add them to:
   - Known mappings (lines 66-224)
   - Extraction patterns (lines 256-288)
   - LLM examples in the prompt

2. Clear problematic cache entries before re-running:
   ```bash
   poetry run python clear_problematic_cache_entries.py
   ```

3. Always test changes:
   ```bash
   poetry run python test_standardization_fixes.py
   ```
